1: Loading Data
Load a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. You can use the read_csv function. Once loaded, display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.

Challenge 2: Data Exploration

How many rows and columns does the DataFrame have?
What are the names of the columns?
What are the data types of each column?

Challenge 3: Filtering Data
Filter the DataFrame to only include rows where a specific column meets a certain condition. For example, filter the DataFrame to only include rows where the 'Age' column is greater than 30.

Challenge 4: Sorting Data
Sort the DataFrame by a specific column in ascending and descending order. Display the top 5 rows for each sorting.

Challenge 5: Grouping and Aggregation
Group the DataFrame by a categorical column and calculate summary statistics for each group. For example, calculate the mean and median of the 'Salary' column for each group.

Challenge 7: Counting
Seperete each group and count them and show how many male and female is in the each group.

Challenge 8: Analysis
Show each groups female and male mean of average scores

#Challenge 9:
#Read file chuck by chunk (Deal with large amounts of data)
