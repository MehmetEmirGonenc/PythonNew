Practice Task 1: Data Filtering and Selection

    In this task, you'll practice filtering and selecting data from the Titanic dataset.

Task 1a: Select Female Passengers

    Select all rows from the Titanic dataset where the "Sex" column is equal to "female." How many female passengers are there?

Task 1b: Select Passengers Aged 25 or Younger

    Select all rows from the Titanic dataset where the "Age" column is 25 or younger. How many passengers are 25 or younger?

Practice Task 2: Data Aggregation and Summary Statistics

    In this task, you'll practice aggregating and calculating summary statistics on the Titanic dataset.

Task 2a: Calculate the Average Fare by Passenger Class

    Calculate the average fare paid by passengers in each passenger class (First Class, Second Class, Third Class).

Task 2b: Calculate the Survival Rate by Passenger Class and Gender

    Calculate the survival rate for passengers in each passenger class and gender. The survival rate is the percentage of survivors in each group.

Practice Task 3: Data Visualization

    In this task, you'll create visualizations using the Titanic dataset.

Task 3a: Create a Bar Chart of Passenger Counts by Class

    Create a bar chart to visualize the number of passengers in each passenger class (First Class, Second Class, Third Class).

Task 3b: Create a Pie Chart of Survival Proportion

    Create a pie chart to visualize the proportion of survivors and non-survivors among passengers.
